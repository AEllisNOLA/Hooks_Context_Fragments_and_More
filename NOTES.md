## 19.190 - The useState Hook
- A React Hook is a function that lets you tap into a React feature, such as state or lifecycle methods.

- React has its own built-in hooks or you can create custom hooks.

- useState allows a (previously stateless) functional component to use component state.

- import { useState } from 'react';

- useState() can take anything in as an argument. No longer must state be an object.
